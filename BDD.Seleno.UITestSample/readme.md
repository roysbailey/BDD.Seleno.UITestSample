BDD UI Tests with Seleno
========================

Simple example showing how to use specflow and seleno to drive simple UI automation acceptance tests.

This sample does NOT use the controller based navigation, or strongly typed page object models, as it is driving an external site we do not have source code for.

Not supposed to be a best practice inmplementation, only a simple implementation to give those new to SpecFlow and Seleno an idea of how it works with a simple example.

Toolset
-------
We are using the following tools.

* c# and .NET
* xunit
* Fluent Assertions
* Specflow
* Seleno
